# random-quote-v2
project 1

this project utilizes javascript arrays to their full potential by building a library of quotes with multiple properties.

a randomized function was created to pull these quotes and their properties and print them to an html page.

the function was designed to not repeat any quote until the array is empty and then start over again.

a 10 second auto push for the print function was utilized to automatically transition from one quote to another.
